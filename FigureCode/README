Files with names beginning with "rCode_Fig_ED" are R scripts that generate Extended Data figures. 

Files with names beginning with "rCode_Supp_Fig" are R scripts that generate Supplementary figures.

Files with names beginning with "rCode_Fig_" are R scripts that generate figures in the main text of the paper.

Some figures do not have associated code:
Supplementary Figure 1 was drawn with Adobe Illustrator so there is no associated code.

Supplementary Figure 2, was produced by HiC-Pro pipeline. 

Supplementary Figure 3, was produced by Juicebox (v1.11.08) by importing the result (*.hic file) generated by the 3D-DNA pipeline.

Supplementary Figure 4, was produced using “BUSCO_plot.py” from BUSCO Package, not a custom script.

Supplementary Figure 5, was produced using a custom script “pca.r”.

Supplementary Figure 6, was produced using “Microsoft Excel” by importing CV error values generated directly by Admixture.

Extended Data Figure 10 was produced by importing the “tree file” (.newick format) and “.Q” files generated by Admixture to the ITOL website (https://itol.embl.de/). The tree file (newick format ) was exported from MEGA(v11.0.13) by importing the “meg” file converted from the PLINK result (*.mdist) by using the “mdist.py” attached.
