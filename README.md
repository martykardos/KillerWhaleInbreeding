recombinationRate: Using the R package FastEPRR to estimate recombination rate across the killer whale genome

populationProjections: Individidual-based simulations of futureu population dynamics

SRKWIsolationTime: estimating expected isolation time for the Southern Resident Killer Whale population

Admixture: Analysis of admixture across North Pacific killer whale populations

Genome_assembly_and_annotation: Assembly and annotation of the killer whale genome

NJtree: Neighbor-joining treee for 147 killer whale genomes

PCA: Principle component analysis of 147 killer whale genomes

SNP_calling: variant calling in killer whale genomes

NeEstimator: linkage disequilibrium based analysis of contemporary effective population size

GONE: linkage disequilibrium based analysis of recent (back to 150 generations ago) changes effective population size

FigureCode: Code used to make figures

quantPop_0.3.9.tar.gz is an R package used in several analyses

demog_models_code contains the code used in the models of fitness components (survival/fecundity) as a function of inbreeding, sex, age, and year
